<title>Express CMS Demo</title>

<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
The JavaXT Express CMS is a simple web server built using
<a href="http://www.javaxt.com/" target="_blank">JavaXT</a>.
It is intended to help developers to get a web server up and running quickly.
If you're reading this page, you're well on your way!
</p>

<p>
This demo has several cool features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Live updates</li>
  <li>Efficient page fetching</li>
  <li>Automated versioning of js and css files for proper caching</li>
  <li>Fail-safe fallback for browsers that don't have javascript enabled</li>
</ul>


<h2>How to customize this site?</h2>
<p>
Now that you have your server up, you are ready to start adding content by
adding or editing files in the "Basic" CMS demo directory.
</p>




<p>
The CMS relies on a template file (e.g. "template.html") found in the "style" folder
that defines the general look and feel of the website.
</p>

<p>
Content for individual pages are separated into individual text files (e.g. *.txt or *.html files).
These text files contain html snippits that are injected into the template at runtime.
</p>

<p>
You can start by editing one of the html files in the "Basic" demo directory (e.g. index.html).
</p>

<p>
Note that you do not have to restart the server to see the changes.
If you have JavaScript enabled, the website will refresh automatically.
Otherwise, all you have to do is refresh the browser.

</p>

<h2>Tabs</h2>


<p>
You can add and remove tabs by updating the tabs.txt file. Note that the
tab file has a &lt;%=Path&gt; tag. This tag will be replaced with a relative path
to the root directory. This is handy when hosting/supporting subsites. There are
many similar tags. You can learn more <a href="/wiki/known_tags/">here</a>.
